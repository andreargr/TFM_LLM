As an expert ontology mapper, I need your help in searching for suitable identifiers in the ontologies with the acronyms CLO, CL, UBERON, and BTO, from a provided label.
The label will be related to biological samples like cell lines, cell types and anatomy structures. 
I need the identifier to be as closely related to the label as possible. 
The input details for your task are as follows:

**Label:**
{label}

Structure your output in the following format:

[CLO_0000000, CL_0000000, UBERON_0000000, BTO_0000000]

Generate appropriate identifiers.
Do not explain your answer, just write the identifiers.
Do not write notes at the end of your writing.
